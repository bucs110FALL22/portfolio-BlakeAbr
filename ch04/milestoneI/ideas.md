# Final Project Milestone #1

[Final Project Description](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j3zgypVjPjzXl4pL1_Wpjvp3GLCW9zcFydkwUjNfNUA/edit?usp=sharing)

In order to start the Final Project for the course, you will need to decide on the following (remember, nothing is set in stone yet).

Review the sample Final Projects listed below and come up with 3 possible ideas of your own for your final project. Complete this document in **your** portfolio (CH 4). A few things to note:

1. ***Don't limit yourself***
    * I will help you scale it to something manageable, but it is  uch easier to scake something down than to scale up. Shoot for the stars.

2. ***Your idea WILL change, don't worry about the details yet.***
    * Just think of a general type of game, simulation, or other kind of program you would like to create.

***

For each one below you should have a basic description of a program idea, a couple of sentences at least. You can add as much info here as you like. This is where you want to brainstorm a little, and nothing is *'wrong'*.

## Project Idea 1

< A platformer game where the character in an elephant that shoots lasers to complete the level. The level would include multiple enemies and obstacles to go through. The elephant would have the ability to have basic movement such as left, right, down, up, etc.  >

## Project Idea 2

< A type of fishing game / tracker. The game works by getting data from different areas about weather and current situations to change the atmosphere. Instead of "levels" like a usual game would work, there would be different regions instead. There could be different fish in every region to catch. >

## Project Idea 3

< A platformer in which the theme is a garden. There are different plots of land and the idea is to complete different levels in order to obtain different seeds. There would also be a fishing minigame that would make you obtain fertilizer to grow your seeds into flowers. >
